# Package Managers

- They automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring and removing computer [software] for a computer's operating system.

- Ubuntu Linux's package manager APT is good and we'll learn about it below, but MacOS' does not have a native package manager installed. We'll go over how to install a third-party package manager for Mac called Homebrew. Please note that other ditros might have different package manager like yum for RedHat & Fedora.

- APT is Linux's own free package manager and it comes natively with Linux so there is no need for installation.

- Homebrew is the package manager for Mac and was written in Ruby.
