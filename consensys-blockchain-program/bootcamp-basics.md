## How To Ask A Question

- Many people incorrectly assume that the most valuable piece of information to a question is its answer. Even more valuable in the long-term is the path taken to find the answer. If you can figure out that path, you not only solve your current problem, you also guarantee a better outcome for any problems you will encounter in the future.

- Some Google Search tricks include:

    - Quotes: ("is he a boy" instead of is he a boy) tells Google to only return results with that exact phrase in it. Extremely helpful if you have a good error message with some noticeable keywords. The more specific your search, the fewer results you'll get!

    - site: enables you to search within a single domain if the website does not have a good internal search engine. eg [site:nytimes.com xxxxx]

    - Using Search Operators: 

        - *: also called a wildcard operator and used when an entire phrase or a specific word cannot be remembered. eg you want to search the lyrics to the Maroon V song "Girls Like You" but cannot remember the lyrics. Search parameter will be "Girls * You"

        - OR operator or |: asks Google to return searches related to at least one of the search terms. It's similar to combining two separate searches: (python OR blockchain) free course

        - Minus(-) operator: used in excluding a term from search results eg, what is blockchain -coingecko

        - Range operators before: and after: allow you to search within a date range. To search for financial tutorials from a certain date range, you can search financial tutorials after:2010 before:2015.

- Might  be helpful to start your search within Stack Overflow itself using the site:stackoverflow.com parameter.

Template for Questions

My question is:
Related to something technical I'm struggling with
A concept I don't understand
A question about logistics in the course (quizzes, grading, final project submission)
For technical questions:

What is your computer environment:
What OS version are you running? (Name and release version, i.e. MacOS Big Sur, Ubuntu 20.04)
If you're asking a question about a specific piece of software or library, what version are you running? Typically, in desktop software, this is found in the "File > About" dropdown menu or, for command line software, by running [PROGRAM-NAME] --version or [PROGRAM-NAME] -v
If you're using npm, what version are you running? use npm -v to find out.
What is your issue:
Describe your problem in general terms.
What did you expect to happen?
What actually happened? Please give examples and provide screenshots of the error. Please copy the error message and provide it when asking the question.
Please provide the shortest amount of steps to reproduce your issue.
Steps already taken:
What have you tried already?
Any promising Google or Stack Overflow results?
What do you think the problem might be?
For questions about concepts you don't understand:

What is the concept you have a question about? Is it in the course, if so, which module or lesson?
What about this concept do you understand? Are there concepts related to it that you do understand?
What about this concept don't you understand?
Using specific keywords, have you searched online or in the Discord chat?
Please link to any relevant documents. If you're asking about something not in the course, please provide a link related to the concept.
For questions about logistics in the course:

What module / lesson are you having trouble with?
Describe your problem in general terms.
What did you expect to happen?
What actually happened?
What have you tried already?
What do you think the problem might be?
While it may seem burdensome to fill out this template, it ensures two things. First, it helps you understand the nature of the problem you're asking about. Sometimes doing that can help us solve our own problems. Second, it provides the valuable context we mentioned above. This increases our chances of finding an answer as it reduces the amount of time and effort needed to understand the basics of the situation. And it provides an asynchronous way of someone else understanding your problem so they can still try to help even if you're not online.
