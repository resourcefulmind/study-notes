# Introduction

Blockchains do not have a single controlling body - all transactions must be safe, and data must be securely maintained on a distributed ledger which follows the predetermined protocol of multiple computers (or nodes) throughout the network coming to a “consensus” to confirm transactional data.

With each new transaction entry comes addition,  examination and a change by each node(recall that a node is simply one of the many computers in the distributed network). To allow this unique kind of transaction authentication, blockchains feature a layered design.

## What are the different layers of Blockchain Architecture?

### Layer 0 Blockchain

It is the network architecture underlying the blockchain. It can be said to be the "network of blockchains" because it comprises of the hardware, protocols, connections, and other components that form the foundation of a blockchain ecosystem.

You would often need a native token to enable participation and development.

Layer 0 also provisions for communication between blockchains and thus enables Interchain operability.

Typical examples are Polkadot, Avalanche, Cardano, and Cosmos

### Layer 1 Blockchain

This symbolizes the actual blockchain as it is responsible for carrying out the bulk of tasks that maintain a blockchain network’s fundamental operations. These fundamental operations include  dispute resolution, consensus mechanism, programming languages, protocols, and restrictions.

Examples of Layer 1 blockchains are Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Bitcoin, and Solana.

There is a snag though. 

As more people get onboarded these Layer 1 blockchains, the amount of computational power required to solve and add blocks to the chain grows, which results in higher fees and longer processing times. This gives rise to scalability concerns.

Different solutions have been proposed including improved consensus mechanisms like **proof of stake** and even sharding (the division of computing operations into smaller parts) but they have been insufficient. This gave rise eventually to Layer 2 blockchains which will be explained next.

### Layer 2 Blockchain

This was introduced to tackle the problem of the extra nodes inclusion that comes from trying to enhance blockchain productivity. More computing power would equal more nodes and the network would be clogged and scalability became a problem.

To solve this, Layer 2 blockchains were introduces as the destination for relocating all processing from layer 1. It is achieved through allowing third-party solutions to be integrated with layer 1.

Layer 2 sits atop layer 1 and manages all the transactional validations whilst constantly exchanging information with it, while Layer 1 is only responsible for managing the addition and creation of new blocks to the blockchain.

A typical example is the Lightning Network as an example of a layer 2 blockchain deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain.

### Layer 3 Blockchain

Also known as the one that provides simplicity and ease to the overall functionality. It is the last layer of the blockchain ecosystem and the one where users interact with a UI.

Users might not really care for the workings of Layers 1 and 2 but Layer 3 ensures that the blockchain is simple for them to use and the functionalities and power that comes with it is easy for the user to understand when using.

Layer 3 also provides utility in the form of intra- and inter-chain operability, such as decentralized exchanges, liquidity provisioning, and staking applications. Decentralized apps (dApps) are a type of layer 3 interface that provides real-world applications for blockchain technology.

Examples of Layer 3 blockchains are decentralized crypto exchanges like Pancake Swap and Uniswap.

## Conclusion

Blockchains are currently extremely sophisticated and still in their budding state. Layer 3 blockchains will need to be more user friendly for onboarding even more people because the creation of real-world blockchain use cases relies heavily on layer three apps being more understandable to the average user.
