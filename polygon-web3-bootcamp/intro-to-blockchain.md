# Introduction To The Blockchain + How It Works

As blockchain continues to grow and become more user-friendly, the onus is on you to learn this evolving technology to prepare for the future. If you are new to blockchain, then this is the right platform to gain solid foundational knowledge. In this article, you learn how to answer the question, “what is blockchain technology?” You’ll also learn how blockchain works, why it’s important, and how you can use this field to advance your career.

## What are the current problems in today's banking system?

- Relatively high cost of transaction fees.
- Double spending. Banks and payment processors are accountable to the local central bank and government. For this reason, they are usually honest. However, the costs imposed by this system are many. Most financial institutions charge fees and impose limits on the size, type, and number of transactions a client can execute. Additionally, transactions can take anywhere from 30-90 days to settle depending on the transaction type.
- Prone to hacking and extraction of sensitive customer data.

## How can a Blockchain solve these problems?

Simple. By decentralization.

- Since it is decentralized, any and everybody can check the status of any transaction. This means that there is no third party fees and automatically very low transaction costs.

- Also in a blockchain, each block is linked to its previous block. If you are trying to spend the same Bitcoin in a second transaction, it will not get verified after the first transaction has been confirmed and thus becomes invalid. The transactions become invalid for a specific cryptocurrency like bitcoin which has already been spent. Makes double spending become as good as impossible.

> Decentralization, Transparency, and Immutability are the 3 main pillars of blockchain technology.

### What is a public ledger?

A public ledger records all bitcoin transactions where it is accessible to everyone associated with the system.

- 100% transparent system and any transaction is visible on there.

- Users get a copy of the blockchain(all transactions) since initiation, once they join a blockchain network.

- First block in a blockhain is called **Genesis block**

- Only user address and transaction details are available. Identity is secured. Keeps the blockchain safe from data tampering.

- Try to hack one block and you have to change the subsequent chains ahead of the block.

### What is Blockchain?

It is a decentralized system of secure and trusted distributed databases. It is a distributed ledger which records and shared the transaction details across many nodes which are part of the network so that the data is not modified. Each and every participant has the same copy of the immutable ledger(cannot be changed)

> In simpler words, a blockchain is a chain of blocks that contain information. It is a distributed ledger that duplicates and distributes transactions across the network of computers participating in the blockchain.

- If a transaction is initiated, it is registered in a block. A block contains aggregated transactions which has to be validated by a miner. The miner gets rewarded for validating the transaction.

> A block is simply a transactional record.

> The chain is the several public databases that are connected through peer-to-peer nodes, where the blocks are stored.

> Blockchain technology is the structure behind the block and the chain.

> The blockchain is like a Google spreadsheet shared among numerous computers in a network, in which, the transactional records are stored based on actual purchases. The fascinating angle is that anybody can see the data, but they can’t corrupt it.

**Most people assume Blockchain and Bitcoin can be used interchangeably, but in reality, that’s not the case. Blockchain is the technology capable of supporting various applications related to multiple industries like finance, supply chain, manufacturing, etc., but Bitcoin is a currency that relies on Blockchain technology to be secure.**

### What are the features that makes blockchain preferable to the traditional ways?

- It is highly secure

Blockchains use digital signature features to conduct fraud-free transactions whereby the data of an individual by the other users without a specific digital signature.

- Decentralized

Instead of banks and governments, approval is gotten from the users' mutual consensus.

- Automation Capability

Can be programmed to perform certain actions, systematic actions and operations like automated payments as long as the conditions set in the program are met.

### Okay...I know what the Blockchain is now, but how does it really work?

The working of the blockhain is the result of combining three leading technologies:

1. Cryptographic keys - Public and Private key.

    - Every user on the chain must have both.
    - Function is to help in performing successful transactions between two parties and to produce a secure digital identity reference aka digital signature.

2. A peer-to-peer network containing a shared ledger.
3. A means of computing, to store the transactions and records of the network.

> The digital signature is merged with the peer-to-peer network; a large number of individuals who act as authorities use the digital signature in order to reach a consensus on transactions, among other issues. When they authorize a deal, it is certified by a mathematical verification, which results in a successful secured transaction between the two network-connected parties. So to sum it up, Blockchain users employ cryptography keys to perform different types of digital interactions over the peer-to-peer network.

### What are the different types of blockchain we have?

1. Private Blockchain Networks

    - Works well for private entities/firms and operates on closed networks.
    - Used mostly for authorization preference customization, parameters customization and important security options.
    - Only one authority/admin.

Examples are CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies), shipping line use cases, Enterprise Ethereum, IBM, Corda, Tezos, et al

2 Public Blockchain Networks

    - Thrive on distributed ledger technology, DLT.
    - Eliminates any form of centralization.
    - Data isn't stored in a single location.
    - A consensus algo is used for verifying information authenticity...usually either Proof of Work or Proof of Stake.

An example is Bitcoin.

3 Permissioned Blockchain

    - Private blockchains that allow special access for others.

4 Consortium Blockchains

    - Have both public and private components.
    - Multiple organizations manage the network.

## Processing a Blockchain Transaction

If two individuals wish to perform a transaction with a private and public key, respectively, the first person party would attach the transaction information to the public key of the second party. This total information is gathered together into a block.

> It should be noted that the block doesn’t include the identities of the individuals involved in the transaction.

The block will include these 4 main headers:

1. Previous hash - hash address locates the previous block.
2. Transaction details -  Details of all the transactions that need to occur.
3. Nonce - An arbitrary number given in cryptography to differentiate the block’s hash address.
4. Preceding hash, transaction details, and nonce are transmitted through a hashing algorithm. This gives an output containing a 256-bit, 64 character length value, which is called the unique ‘hash address.’ Consequently, it is referred to as the hash of the block.

> Blockchain miners attempt to solve a mathematical puzzle using computational algorithm, which is referred to as a proof of work problem. Whoever solves it first gets a reward and the transaction is completed.

## What does the term "Mining" mean in Blockchain?

In Blockchain technology, the process of adding transactional details to the present digital/public ledger is called ‘mining.’

It involves generating the hash of a block transaction, which is tough to forge, thereby ensuring the safety of the entire Blockchain without needing a central system.

## Too much tech jargon...how to use in Real life cases?

- Can be used in product tracking and supply chain logistics.
- Can store information on monetary transactions using cryptocurrencies.
- Micro-loans and micro-payments
- Blockchain technology can be used as a secure platform for the healthcare industry for the purposes of storing sensitive patient data. Health-related organizations can create a centralized database with the technology and share the information with only the appropriately authorized people.
- In the private consumer world, blockchain technology can be employed by two parties who wish to conduct a private transaction. However, these kinds of transactions have details that need to be hammered out before both parties can proceed:

- What are the terms and conditions (T&C) of the exchange?
- Are all the terms clear?
- When does the exchange start?
- When will it finish?
- When is it unfair to halt the exchange?

Since blockchain technology employs a shared ledger, distributed ledger on a decentralized network, all parties involved can quickly find answers to these questions by researching “blocks” in the “chain.” Transactions on a blockchain platform can be tracked from departure to the destination by all of the transactions on the chain.

- Scenario: food products can be tracked from the moment they are shipped out, all throughout their journey, and up until final delivery. This information can be helpful because if there is a contamination outbreak, the source of the outbreak can be easily traced.

## Conclusion

Blockchain possesses great potential for the future and encourages transparency and decentralization. Another major advantage is the level of security it can provide by protecting and securing sensitive data from online transactions. It is also quite fast anf convenient as it completes under a few minutes. There is also no government interference although in recent times, this has come under heavy fire from regulators and government financial agencies alike.

On the other hand, the adoption of private keys and the immutability of transactions means that if a loser loses their private keys, their valuables can be lost forever. Also, scalability is a major issue as number of transactions per node is limited and it can take several hours to finish multiple transactions.
