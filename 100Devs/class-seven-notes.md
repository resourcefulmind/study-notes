## Networking In Tech

- Networking gets you the job faster than being the best coder in the world. It is just what it is.
- Major goal of networking is to turn a stranger into a friend and that friend into a co-worker.

        Stranger --> Acquaintance --> Friend --> Referral --> Co-worker

- It is continuous and it is important to get referrals because you will most likely:
        1. Skip the first round interview
        2. Go straight to technical
        3. Companies pay their staff bonuses for referrals.
        4. Gets your resume to the top of the stack.
        5. Whoever is referring you will make sure there is a follow up.

- Don't go bombarding someone with messages without rhyme and reason. You just want a referral but you do not take the time to get to make the person your friend. IT IS WRONGGGGG. Say no to SPAMMING.
- Don't just add just about anybody on LinkedIn trying to rack up connects. You're better off having people you have actually interacted with on your LinkedIn.
- You can read books on how to make friends. A typical example will be "How To Win Friends And Influence People". Mpst importantly, practice what you learn in the books.

## Event Oriented

- Where to meet said people to turn into friends? ATTEND EVENTS AND MEETUPS, ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT RE-OCCUR. The re-occurrence will eventually make you meet a few people. First time hey and two more hellos will go a long way. 
- Build rapport when it is time for the breakout sessions where you are broken up into smaller groups.
- Local meetups are better too.
- Check the closest city with the most jobs...that's where your networking should start even if you do not live there.
- Make one your friend and their friends will be in your network too.
- When you pick your locale, find the places the events get posted to and ask for directions to more of them and then you can streamline.

## Conferences
- Large amounts of people come to these.
- People there actually want to meet new folks.
- How to search? Put in your "interests + conferences" on Google. You could even add a location.
- A lot of them are free. There's a way to get into conferences for free.
- If the conference costs money, send them an email telling them you are a newbie and asking for discounts and/or free.
- You can volunteer too. Yet another way to network because your fellow volunteers are potential connections.
- Offer to do group things like getting lunch together to further conversations.

## Communities
- There are slack and discord communities that can be beneficial too.

## Apps
- Lunchclub
- Bumble Bizz

## Friends and Family also play a very important part.
- They will help you spread word.
- Refer you to jobs.
- Those people you get introduced to can also connect you to someone else.


## FOLLOW UP FLOW

        Meet Someone --> Email Next Day(Provide Value) --> Add Them On LinkedIn --> DM & Follow on Twitter
                                Next Day                        3 days Later                Day 6

## FLOW FOR COFFEE CHAT
Email Follow Up 1 (1 week) --> Email Follow-Up(Two Weeks) --> Last Email(1 month)
## Have a spreadsheet to keep track of these people you are networking with so when the time comes you know who to reach out to and have the right ammo such as subjects of interest to use in laying your groundwork. Also, this helps you not to forget important things about your connections.

## Use Google Alerts to create alerts about what your connection and/or their organizations are up to. That way you can easily even check on their feeds and make comments or compliments when necessary.
## MORE TIPS

- Breathe if you get overwhelmed. Good things take time

## RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN
    For a site to be considered responsive, it needs to have 3 qualities;
- Fluidity (when everything is a percentage or can respond natively)
- Elasticity (Setting our fonts and texts to use a responsive unit of measure like em or rem)
- Content Decisions (The way our sites look and the decisions we make on the content at certain sizes of our screens...asking questions like on mobile, what do you want them to see?)
- Media Queries are used to make content decisions at different screen sizes.
- Mobile first is the idea of adding the most important stuff to accommodate mobile screens first and then adding more as the screen sizes increases.
