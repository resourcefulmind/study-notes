## Networking Review

- Expanding Normal Follow Up


        Meet Someone --> Email Next Day(Provide Value) --> Add Them On LinkedIn --> DM & Follow on Twitter
                                Next Day                        3 days Later                Day 6


- For Meet: Probably at a meetup or conference or online.
- For Email: You can ask for email and then send something along the lines of (stating how you met, provide some value, thank the person for their time)
- For LinkedIn: Do not add without a message
- You can get people's emails from Hunter.io by just typing their names and the companies they work for.
- If you are remote, look for the city with the most jobs and start your networking there.
- First find local meetups, and then to find more meetups, ask the people you talk to at your current meetup.

Hi Leon,

It was a pleasure meeting you last night! The event was so well done and it was exciting meeting such an amazing group of people - I hope you are enjoying a well deserved break after pulling it all together!

Also, I don't know if you saw this yet, but someone just bought a $375k first edition pokemon booster box and it wound up being fake! The Gaurdian covered it and I remember you mentioned being a big fan. Hope you have a great rest of the week!

Cheers,

Bob

Hi Leon,

As I mentioned last night, I'm just starting my engineering career and would love to learn from successful people such as yourself. Please let me know if there might be a time you are free to grab a virtual coffee over the next week or two. Before 9am or after 5pm tends to work best for me, but happy to accommodate what works for you. Thanks!

- Don't be creepy and bring datey vibes to a coffee chat. Keep it one hundred percent professional.

## Progressive Enhancement

- The core of your websites should be HTML.
- Your sites should not be heavy because not everybody has access to high-speed internet broadband.
