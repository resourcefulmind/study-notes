# What is the Terminal

- It is a place where you type commands on the computer that cause actions.

## What is a CLI

- It is short for Command Line Interface. It is the actual place where you type the commands to use the computer. What you see on most Sci-Fi movies like The Matrix. A good example is the Apple II 

### What is a GUI

- It is short for the Graphical User Interface. That is tech jargon for the computer with the screens that you see these days with the beautiful folders and screens and stuff. 

- For MAC_OS, you probably already have **Terminal** on your system. (Applications -> Terminal)

- For Linux, you can download it

- For Windows, you can download **GitBash** (https://gitforwindows.org) and later on you can use **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**

#### Some common commands are:

- `pwd` stands for "Print Working Directory" and  it will show the user where they are inclusive of the path. A directory simply means folder as well.

- `mkdir` stands for "Make Directory" and will create a folder.

- `cd` means "create directory" and enables a user to open a new folder. eg `cd Desktop`

- `cd ..` will make the user go up a level in the directory path. It's like going from a child-folder to the immediate parent-folder.

`cd` will take you inside a folder and `cd ..` will take you out one level from child to immediate parent.

- `cd ~` will take you all the way back to the home folder

- `cd <folder>/<subfolder>/` is used when you want to proceed to a specific path.

- `clear` will clear the terminal.

- `touch <name-of-file>` will create a new file eg `touch index.html`

- `ls` will show you a list of all the files contained in the current folder at any given time.

- `ls -l` will give us the list and more information like the name, the date of creation and permissions on the file

- `ls -la` will show you the list and all the information about the files including the hidden stuff.

- `rm <name-of-file>` will remove a file. eg `rm index.html`.

- `rm -r <folder>` will remove/delete a folder.

- `rm -rf <folder>` will remove forcefully/permanently.

- `code <filename>` will open a file in VScode. 
The user has to go to the command palette in their VS code --> View --> Install code command with PATH  and then they can use this.
