## Why?
- Freelancing is for the money and the experience.
- You should have something that shows that you are a good fit.
- The more clients you have, the easier it is for you to get that big job you have been looking for.

## How To Play The Freelancing Game  
- Never undervalue yourself
- You are being paid for the value and the work you have put in to learn your skill.
- Freelancing means working as an independent person or company rather than being employed by someone else.
- Other names for freelancers are 1099, self-employed, independent contractor, etc
- Employed people get w2 forms, freelancers get 1099 in the US.
- Set aside money for your tax

## Online Persona
- Decent Portfolio, Twitter and Linkedin
- It's way easier to use your name across social media platforms. The benefit is that you will be easier to be found and easier to sign contracts and stuff. 
- Keep it simple.
- put the homework stuffs on there.
- use netlify for the forms
- using a template is totally allowed.

# Twitter
- Throw the "junior" and "aspiring" thingy out the window
- Make your twitter speak for what you believe in and what you do
- A portfolio and twitter helps because twitter ranks very high.

# Linkedin
- Should show three things...what you did in the past, what you're doing now(freelance experience until you get a job) and your bootcamp experience.

- Talk about your past experience as something that would lead you into tech
- Talk about your bootcamp experience but as an agency not as a bootcamp and say they have a training.

Homework: Portfolio, twitter and Linkedin

- if you are not a designer, use a template for yourself and your portfolio.
