## Why?
- Freelancing is for the money and the experience.
- You should have something that shows that you are a good fit.
- The more clients you have, the easier it is for you to get that big job you have been looking for.

## How To Play The Freelancing Game  
- Never undervalue yourself
- You are being paid for the value and the work you have put in to learn your skill.
- Freelancing means working as an independent person or company rather than being employed by someone else.
- Other names for freelancers are 1099, self-employed, independent contractor, etc
- Employed people get w2 forms, freelancers get 1099 in the US.
- Set aside money for your tax

## Online Persona
- Decent Portfolio, Twitter and Linkedin
- It's way easier to use your name across social media platforms. The benefit is that you will be easier to be found and easier to sign contracts and stuff. 
- Keep it simple.
- put the homework stuffs on there.
- use netlify for the forms
- using a template is totally allowed.

# Twitter
- Throw the "junior" and "aspiring" thingy out the window
- Make your twitter speak for what you believe in and what you do
- A portfolio and twitter helps because twitter ranks very high.

# Linkedin
- Should show three things...what you did in the past, what you're doing now(freelance experience until you get a job) and your bootcamp experience.

- Talk about your past experience as something that would lead you into tech
- Talk about your bootcamp experience but as an agency not as a bootcamp and say they have a training.

Homework: Portfolio, twitter and Linkedin

- if you are not a designer, use a template for yourself and your portfolio.
- sites to get templates from
html5up.net
wrapbootstrap.com
themeforest.net

# hosting
You can use Netlify for that

# How to get clients
- Networking
- Listings
- PLACES YOU KNow
- Localization is of great value
- Talk to the owners of some of the places that you go to chill and do stuff
- Check whether they have a website, if they don't, offer to build one. If they do, offer to improve it.

- Overbound means picking a niche and going for it
- Introduce yourself appropriately as you are networking and meeting people for example; 
"Hi I am Opeyemi, I am a software engineer and I build websites and web applications for clients in the Lagos Area"
- Do that to everyone you meet and register yourself in their brains

- Use local listings like craigslist, upwork, facebook marketplaces et al
- Talk to everyday places that you go to, barbershops, lounges, hotels, clubs and stuff.
- Do they have a web presence? Do they want something better?
- Your niche could be restaurants or plumbing businesses or hotel reservations.
- Compile a list of the niche
- Find the businesses in that niche and put them on a sheet
- CALL them up. New or improved businesses. Use picture with the questions you took on your phone(note to self)
- Build a landing page if you are going in as an agency or your own portfolio if it's just you.

# Building Authority
- Pick something and become an expert around it

# PROPOSAL
- It is a simple walkthrough of what you are going to provide, i.e what will be delivered to the client.
- Use proposify and panda docs for samples
- Namecheap free logo maker can be used to make a logo

# Contracts
- It is not for a fight but to protect both parties when things tend to go wrong.
- Use stuff and nonsense - contract killer on github or Sam's California/US modification.

# NEVER LEAVE OUT THE INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSES (Note to self: See the picture on your phone about important bits)

# How To Close
- Comes down to a question
[Tell me everything about your project]

- Youtube channel for building an agency. (The future, chris dell)
- [What is your ballpark budget?]
- BE FIRM, BE CLEAR, UNDER PROMISE, OVER DELIVER.
- LEAVE ENOUGH ROOM TO GET HELP. DOUBLE THAT DELIVERY DATE.
- COMMUNICATE REGULARLY
- GET HELP WHEN NEEDED.
