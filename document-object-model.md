## What is the DOM

- It is short for DOcument Object Model
- It is a tree of nodes/elements creted by the browser
- We can use JS to read/write/manipulate the DOM and her elements.
- It is object oriented which means each node has its own properties and methods that we can use in changing and adding and removing things.
- The DOM model tree consists of the Document itself at the apex of the tree and is followed by the root element which is the html. The html have their children beneath the root which is the head and body element and those have others like titles, attributes and h1s which have their own children like texts.
